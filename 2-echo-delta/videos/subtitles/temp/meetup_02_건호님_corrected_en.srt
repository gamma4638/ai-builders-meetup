00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
Hello. I'm Gunho Shin from DAY1COMPANY.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,259
Today's topic is "Highly Advanced AX is Indistinguishable from Entrepreneurship."

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,599
That's the theme.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,859
I made the slides quite text-heavy,

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,859
but since the presentation materials will be shared afterwards,

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:21,179
I wrote them so you can understand the details by reading them.

7
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,039
Let me go through this quickly.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,480
Three things for today.

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,780
First, I'll share what I learned from losing AX opportunities,

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,920
explaining why highly advanced AX is indistinguishable from entrepreneurship,

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:44,760
and from that perspective, I prepared this presentation to share my AX playbook rules.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,680
Let me start with the first point.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,980
Since today is Echo & Delta, I'm going to claim that I'm an AX consultant,

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,840
so I brought a brief overview of my career path.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,760
So about consultants.

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,520
A characteristic of consultants is that they always have a broad but shallow skill set,

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,439
and now I'm serving as the Head of B2B Division at DAY1COMPANY,

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,780
tasked with generating revenue or operating profit.

19
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,299
So I'm doing BD.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,460
What's really scary is what I realized after doing BD for a year -

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,460
I worked logically.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,159
And?

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,939
So I solved problems.

24
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:23,480
And?

25
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,740
So did that generate revenue and profit?

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,740
I should be able to answer that, and it's quite scary.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,780
Because if it doesn't work out, 100 people's salaries are at stake,

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,780
so 2025 was a year with enormous pressure.

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,780
Before that, I was a PO at DOIT, did consulting for over 2 years,

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,780
then did Python-based modeling in the financial sector,

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,780
then dabbled in ML/DL at Karst,

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,780
so I have a history of developing an engineer's mindset.

33
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,780
So at my current company, as Head of Division, my role is to bring in money.

34
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
So at my current company, as Head of Division, my role is to bring in money.

35
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,780
So at my current company, as Head of Division, my role is to bring in money.

36
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,780
Fortunately, I'm in an environment where I can explore the topic of AX deeply.

37
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:13,780
Since we provide AX training extensively to enterprise-level customers,

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,780
I get to hear a lot about what AX needs exist at the corporate level.

39
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,780
After all, wanting AX training means they want to do AX, right?

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,780
So naturally I hear these needs, but of course they're vague.

41
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
The training they want is also vague,

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,780
so now these early adopter-like

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
so now these early adopter-like

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,780
customers - I meet them, diagnose their needs, structure them, and say "this is the training you need."

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:42,780
Through this process, I thought we could launch a new business combining consulting and SRL,

46
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,780
so we're planning to launch it next year.

47
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,780
If external customers are on the left,

48
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,780
internally, my goal isn't to do AX per se - I need to make money,

49
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,780
and increasing productivity is the best number one priority,

50
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,780
and since it's currently AX, I've tried all sorts of things.

51
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,780
To increase productivity,

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,780
internal training alone doesn't improve productivity,

53
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,780
so I thought "I need to build this myself,"

54
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,780
built it and deployed those projects.

55
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:22,780
GPTs projects, dashboards, James GPTs that makes agents - I've been actively trying to deploy these.

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,780
This November, I aggressively set up an AI Transformation team,

57
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,780
but of course, as Donghun mentioned, resources aren't sufficient.

58
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,780
"I don't care what you do, just make money" - that's the mandate,

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,780
so I can't open job postings,

60
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,780
so I just picked the four smartest people from the training team and reassigned them.

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,780
They didn't know n8n, but started studying it,

62
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,780
and now after various trials and errors, they're completely rebuilding the proposal Workflow.

63
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:56,780
Once Ridi fixes it, it eventually outputs to customers as a PPT proposal.

64
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,780
It seems to be going pretty well actually.

65
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,780
That's my current situation with AX.

66
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,780
My core question is: How can we make AI Transformation successful?

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,780
And beyond individual productivity, how do we manage this at the organizational level?

68
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:21,779
I believe those attending today probably have the same questions.

69
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,779
Now, about the technology adoption curve -

70
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,779
where do you think today's attendees are on this curve?

71
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:34,779
You're probably right here, of course,

72
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:40,779
but from my experience doing AX meetings and training for large enterprises and looking at internal operations,

73
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,779
people here are around this point.

74
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,779
So you're extremely outlier-level individuals.

75
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:50,779
Where is my organization's leadership from a business perspective?

76
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:53,779
If they're here, great.

77
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,779
And where are the counterparties I need to transform -

78
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,779
marketing team, training team, sales team - if they're here, great.

79
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,779
But to increase organizational productivity beyond individual productivity,

80
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,779
I have to force this on these people.

81
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,779
So it's something I have to do.

82
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:14,779
I have to do all this with them, and they're usually like this.

83
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:19,779
"Why should I coordinate with you?" - it ends up being a difficult task.

84
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,779
And C-level executives don't easily give resources.

85
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,779
From that perspective, unless you're in a leadership position in this era,

86
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:32,779
the opportunity itself to do organization-level AX

87
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:36,779
is limited to maybe two or three tries even for leaders.

88
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,779
So what I want to say is, since it's this difficult,

89
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:46,779
if I share what I learned from successful and failed AX attempts,

90
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,779
maybe you can reduce trial and error?

91
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,779
Maybe waste fewer tickets?

92
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,779
The first thing I did was

93
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,779
to start with building a proposal search system beyond just training.

94
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,779
So we have training consultants who hear client needs

95
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,779
and design training to propose - that workflow exists.

96
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,779
So I proceeded by the book initially.

97
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,779
Obviously interviewed and mapped the workflow.

98
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,779
Drew it all out.

99
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:19,779
So before I made agents that could draw these,

100
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,779
I built it so when this goes in, that comes out.

101
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,779
Wow! Amazing! Great! - thinking that.

102
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,779
Built it, and obviously after workflow analysis, what do you do next?

103
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,779
Bottleneck analysis, right?

104
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:35,779
So I looked and found that collecting internal materials

105
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,779
was consuming too much time.

106
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:41,779
So depending on client characteristics, the proposals to reference are different,

107
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:45,779
but they're all in Drive, 300 of them, having to open and check each one.

108
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,779
I thought "This is a perfect low hanging fruit for AX" and built it.

109
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,779
Resources invested - at that time there was a strategy team,

110
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:59,779
practitioner interviews, the production team summarized, I planned,

111
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:04,779
the Product Group Head developed it, first deployment, feedback, second deployment, etc.

112
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:07,779
And then it failed.

113
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,779
Nobody really uses it now.

114
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,779
It's just sitting there abandoned.

115
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:15,779
So that was one failed AX case.

116
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,779
But then, among various attempts, the successful one

117
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,779
was the Skills Consulting service pipeline.

118
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:27,779
AX-ing this service was a very successful experience.

119
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:33,779
To explain simply, Skills Consulting is

120
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,779
for battery solutions, EV batteries companies,

121
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:43,779
from Rbnp, about 80 teams and 100 job roles,

122
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,779
defining the software skills they need and building the training system.

123
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,779
18 weeks, something like that.

124
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:50,779
What I want to say is, when we do Skills Consulting for places like Lotte Department Store,

125
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:51,779
this becomes Skills Consulting.

126
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:52,779
What I want to say is, when we do Skills Consulting for places like Lotte Department Store,

127
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:53,779
this becomes Skills Consulting.

128
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:54,779
What I want to say is, this is Skills Consulting for places like Lotte Department Store.

129
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,779
this is Skills Consulting.

130
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:56,779
What I want to say is this is Skills Consulting.

131
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:57,779
This team handles it, but since I was a consultant,

132
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,779
I immediately sensed that keeping this under me would cause problems.

133
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,779
I felt that even with minimum 4 people pulling all-nighters for 2 weeks straight, time would be short.

134
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:08,779
At that time there was no workflow analyzer or anything,

135
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,779
so I built all the logic from start to finish and made agents,

136
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:18,779
and finally deployed the interview questionnaire creation via vibe coding.

137
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,779
Obviously in that process, to establish the logic

138
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:28,779
as an agent, as a consultant, I worked out all the questions with GPT.

139
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,779
I developed this myself.

140
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:39,779
Then after mapping out the AX pipeline for this difficult consulting work,

141
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,779
I ran about 5 iterations by myself.

142
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:47,779
Built the logic, saw it cost up to 3000 won, realized the logic was too heavy.

143
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,779
Came back and redid everything from start to finish.

144
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,779
What was really interesting is that in consulting,

145
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,779
you can't run these kinds of iterations. Unlike development.

146
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:00,779
You have to grind through manually and only see results 8 weeks later.

147
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,779
But working with AI, I ran 5 iterations and then deployed to the team.

148
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:11,779
So I alone spent 5 hours each on Saturday, Sunday, Monday to build and bring it - it's quite complex.

149
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,779
5 GPTs are connected, JSON from #1 goes into #2,

150
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:22,779
then the GPT analysis result from #2 goes sequentially into the next, and so on until this point.

151
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,779
Then when you upload, it creates the interview questionnaire in Excel.

152
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:33,779
In a way, this was a much more unfamiliar workflow

153
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:41,779
than the proposal system, and I wondered if the people who actually understand this would use it.

154
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,779
But this was actually a huge success. Everyone switched over.

155
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:50,779
They don't know what JSON is, but they use it. Just going to this webpage link.

156
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:55,779
Working in companies, when you tell people "go to this link and use it," they never do.

157
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:01,779
Those links get abandoned, but this one - everyone switched to the new workflow at near suicide-squad level.

158
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,779
So I thought the decisive difference is just one thing.

159
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:11,779
First, I learned that the magnitude of utility determines AX success.

160
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,779
Looking at the failure, the existing proposal search time was about 1-2 hours, about 1 hour,

161
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:18,779
and using this reduced it to about 15 minutes.

162
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,779
About 4x improvement.

163
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:28,779
In the AX success case, if you didn't use this and didn't switch workflows, doing it the old way

164
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:33,779
would take 120 hours working 12 hours a day for 2 weeks,

165
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,779
but using this you can finish today and go home.

166
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,779
Then everyone uses it.

167
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,779
So I always thought 10x, 20x efficiency means I'll definitely switch.

168
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,779
4x, 30x - not a chance.

169
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,779
Reflecting on why else it succeeded:

170
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,779
the pain size was large, it was done better AI-Native,

171
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:59,779
communication cost was very high back then but this I did alone - maybe that's why it worked?

172
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:06,779
Also strange - looking at domain knowledge, I had written way more proposals, less Skills Consulting.

173
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,779
In terms of tech stack, I used it more heavily back then.

174
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,779
But this time I only used GPTs.

175
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,779
Leadership drive was the same since I drove both.

176
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,779
So nowadays I feel individual components alone

177
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:22,779
lack explanatory power for why success and failure happen. It's unsatisfying.

178
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,779
But what flashed through my mind was:

179
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,779
"Huh? This is really no different from entrepreneurship" - I reached that thought.

180
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:38,779
So the core point is, if you think carefully about the first common point between AX and software startups,

181
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:43,779
success ultimately comes from getting customers to use the new product.

182
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:45,779
That means customers must overcome

183
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,779
the switching cost from existing to new products.

184
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,779
So Ben Horowitz said

185
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,779
"If you don't make a 10x better product, they won't switch."

186
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,779
That principle.

187
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,779
Zero to One also says 10x.

188
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,779
This concept of 10x utility kept staying in my head.

189
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,779
You need at least that much to overcome switching costs.

190
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,779
It's really similar to startups, I thought.

191
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,779
Ultimately, both startups and AX need to deliver products with 10x utility

192
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,779
to customers,

193
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,779
so you can borrow startup frameworks almost exactly.

194
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,779
In startups, what do we often say when capturing market?

195
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,779
It's crucial to capture a big market.

196
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,779
I'm talking about big markets.

197
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,779
What is "market" in AX?

198
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:34,779
What is it?

199
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,779
It's time, right?

200
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,779
That time actually means the time spent per organization and workflow type.

201
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:43,779
That time actually means the time spent per organization and workflow type.

202
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:44,779
That time, that time, that time.

203
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,779
The amounts of time spent are all different markets.

204
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,779
Those times are the market size.

205
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,779
To maintain authority by succeeding with limited resources,

206
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,779
to maintain authority by succeeding with limited resources,

207
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,779
you need to pick where the bottleneck size is large, like with startups.

208
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,779
In startups, we always talk about MVP.

209
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:06,779
Naturally, we're doing AX through POCs. It seemed like the obvious approach.

210
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,779
It seems like the natural way.

211
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,779
And startups talk a lot about PMF.

212
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:13,779
And startups talk a lot about PMF.

213
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:18,779
In startups, they say you've found PMF when customers pay directly.

214
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,779
So what does finding PMF mean in AX?

215
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:30,779
It's not just "tried it, liked it" - it needs to be a POC level where they can't go back to the old way to call it finding PMF.

216
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:38,779
And from a product-market perspective, customers are exactly those organization members using my product.

217
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:40,779
This means "AI can't find anything."

218
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:41,779
This means "AI can't find anything."

219
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,779
So whether it's customers I don't know, marketing team, sales team - doesn't matter.

220
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:58,779
Anyway, I need to match their needs, design user flows so they naturally go through to the end - that's when you've found PMF.

221
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:07,779
There are investors too. Startups need to prove cash to get VC investment. Who's the investor in AX?

222
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,779
Upper-level decision makers.

223
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:10,779
When I invest, I...

224
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:17,779
I need to prove ROI on the resources I extracted for decision makers to invest more in me.

225
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,779
There's runway too. In startups, runway means shutdown when cash runs out.

226
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:25,779
What's runway and organizational shutdown for an AX team?

227
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:26,779
Loss of trust.

228
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:31,779
Right. When internal members' and upper decision makers' trust runs out, it's just shutdown.

229
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:33,779
Your authority gets taken away.

230
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,779
In terms of difficulty, everyone knows making a startup successful is extremely hard.

231
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:39,779
I actually view AX as the same difficulty level.

232
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,779
Honestly, if you can succeed at this, you might as well start a company.

233
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,779
At least you'd make more money.

234
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,779
This has no money and it's hard. Painful.

235
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,779
But inevitably it's not quite at that level.

236
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:58,779
So when I see many people on LinkedIn saying "We did POC, why isn't the next step working?"

237
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:04,779
Of course. Obviously you made MVP but what comes next is packed like a startup. AX is the same.

238
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,779
What comes after POC is the real deal, so obviously.

239
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:08,779
POC success doesn't mean

240
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,779
AX success.

241
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:19,779
From that perspective, if an AX builder is essentially like an entrepreneur, what capability combination is needed to succeed at AX?

242
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:24,779
So I thought about it, and since today is Echo & Delta meetup,

243
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:29,779
there's Delta and Echo, but I think additional capabilities are needed beyond that.

244
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:37,779
What I mean is: PO and PM capabilities must also combine for true AX Full-Stack.

245
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:49,779
Consultant capabilities mean quickly breaking down problems, structuring bottlenecks, forming hypotheses, iterating logic - but the key is doing it incredibly fast.

246
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:56,779
Hear it, break it down immediately, run through the logic, run it through agents, "oh the results aren't good," come back and iterate.

247
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,779
Being able to do this really fast means you have AX consultant capabilities.

248
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,779
Obviously PO capabilities are needed too.

249
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,779
What kind of being is a human? How lazy do they hate being?

250
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,779
You need product sense for things people use, concepts of iteration,

251
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,779
and obsession about problem relationships to succeed.

252
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,779
I learned a lot about this at DOIT.

253
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,779
Anyway, PO capabilities with this obsession are needed, and PM too.

254
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,779
Ultimately you need to persuade highly ineffective counterparties while doing AX,

255
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,779
and leadership doesn't give much approval time,

256
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:36,779
so you need PM capabilities to manage timelines while assembling the plane before hitting the ground,

257
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:37,779
recovering,

258
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,779
doing POCs, making them successful, doing the main project, etc.

259
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:46,779
Really no different from an entrepreneur. You'd be better off starting a company.

260
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:49,779
Anyway.

261
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,779
Still, what mindset should you have when doing AX?

262
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:58,779
Entrepreneurs think "Nothing is impossible. I've found my thing."

263
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:04,779
But we need the mindset: "Nothing is impossible for AI. I just prompted it wrong."

264
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:06,779
Just go at it with everything you've got.

265
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:10,779
That's my view on the necessary mindset.

266
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,779
So I want to share three playbook items today.

267
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:21,779
First, going thin but E2E makes it easier to quickly achieve 10X.

268
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,779
Interpreting through the startup framework,

269
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:29,779
there's always a gap between ideal and reality. As a business unit head who really needs to deliver,

270
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:35,779
initially you think when you map out the ideal workflow, everyone will follow the textbook organizational workflow,

271
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:37,779
but absolutely not.

272
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,779
Everyone has their own workflow actually.

273
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:43,779
So after more detailed interviews, when I charted it,

274
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:47,779
everyone's proposal-making workflow looks completely different.

275
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:56,779
Since there's practically no common denominator, attacking a specific bottleneck section of the workflow is actually quite difficult.

276
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:04idth
So there's the thick and partial approach, or thin but going all the way - I think the right approach is better.

277
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:15,779
Partially defining some section as a bottleneck and doing AX there is actually targeting only a subset based on some interviewees' bottleneck intersection,

278
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:21,779
meaning you're likely targeting an even smaller market.

279
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:23,779
It doesn't become organization-level AX.

280
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:27,779
With E2E, what can we trust? Not the workflow,

281
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,779
but ultimately any workflow has inputs and outputs.

282
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:34,779
And everyone uses the same input somehow

283
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:35,779
to make the final deliverable, the proposal,

284
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:37,779
the same way.

285
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:40,779
So approaching E2E has higher likelihood of becoming organization-level AX.

286
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:41,779
This is the truth.

287
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,779
This is actually not the truth.

288
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:53,779
Second, going thick and deep handling all edge cases has a very high chance of getting shut down before even doing MVP/POC.

289
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,779
Because they don't give you a month.

290
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,779
Regardless.

291
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,779
"So did you make money? What happened? Why?" - they ask these questions.

292
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,779
So going thin is better,

293
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:10,779
so the iteration loop can really spin fast and there's higher chance of discovering "that's the real problem."

294
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:15,779
Actually going thin but E2E was my first painful lesson.

295
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:21,779
Second, just rebuilding AI-Native from scratch makes achieving 10X somewhat easier.

296
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:25,779
Elon Musk's first principles thinking is valid for AX too.

297
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:29,779
Breaking down complex problems to the most basic, fundamental level

298
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:32,779
is first principles thinking.

299
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:33,779
"Rockets are expensive so can't be made."

300
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,779
But at that price, what are rockets made of?

301
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,779
Raw materials are these? Not that expensive?

302
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,779
What's the fundamental cost needed for rocket manufacturing?

303
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:49,779
Like digging into that, when doing AX in organizations and hearing "this requires lots of work, testing alone costs 10 billion,"

304
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:55,779
rather than just believing that and looking at the workflow,

305
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,779
ultimately we're doing manual labor.

306
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:02,779
All our activities convert low-value information to high-value information.

307
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:05,779
All activities.

308
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,779
Since we left manual labor behind in the Industrial Revolution.

309
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:14,779
So ultimately all acts of creating high-value information -

310
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:17,779
let's break down all the processes where information value increases.

311
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:24,779
Then if agents handle this instead of humans, how much testing can be eliminated? Erase everything,

312
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:30,779
and then automating through AX is much better than starting from human workflows.

313
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,779
Trust only the output and input of work.

314
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:40,779
Question the taken-for-granted tests in human work when thinking about giving it to agents,

315
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:45,779
and going AI-Native, simply erasing everything, makes achieving 10X much easier.

316
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,779
That's the second point.

317
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,779
Finally, you must become an AX Full-Stack.

318
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:55,779
Because before Trust & Patience Burn, before the Runway runs out,

319
00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:00,779
before the trust and patience balance depletes, you need speed to succeed.

320
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:02,779
So they gave you time, a month passed.

321
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:07,779
When asked what happened, some effect or transition needs to show

322
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,779
for continued investment from the CEO.

323
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:16,779
So ultimately you need to be Full-Stack from an AX perspective to succeed at this

324
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,779
in our organization.

325
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,779
In my case, I'm Echo but working hard to become Delta

326
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:25,779
through Codex and experimenting.

327
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:29,779
Many of today's attendees are in product roles,

328
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:33,779
and from that perspective, product-focused engineers and developers

329
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,779
need to keep expanding Delta-to-Echo capability building

330
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:41,779
to become Full-Stack, gain speed, and succeed.

331
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:43,779
That's my final conclusion. Thank you.
